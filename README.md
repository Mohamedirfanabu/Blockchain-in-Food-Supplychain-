1. Problem Statment
                Food traceability is one of the common challenges faced in global agri-food sector. It takes 
        weeks to track the entire lifecycle of food products right from origin of cultivation to end 
        consumer through every point of contact on its journey. When an 
        outbreak of a food-borne disease happens, it can take days, if not weeks, to find its source. 
        Better traceability could help save lives by allowing companies to act faster and protect the 
        livelihoods of farmers by only discarding produce from the affected farms.
        
 2. Solution Proposed
            Food tracebility can be achieved through blockchain technology by bringing all the stakeholders of the agro to retail supply chain to use an blochchain technology
    where the information like time taken in logistics and the process the product has went through is captured and stored in blockchain at each stages. there by the source and
    life of agro products can be made transperent to all the stakeholder especially to retailer and the end customers. This increases tracebility and transperancy there by         making customers aware of products and help stakeholders aware of drawbacks in their current logistical operations and improve them.

 3. Developed Food Tracebility System:=
            1) Included Stakeholders: Farmers, Food Processor, Distributors, Retailors-> Consumers
            2) Tools Used: Anaconda Jupyter, VS Studio, Postman
            3) Python Libraries: Streamlit, Flask, Pymango, Json, Hashlib 
            4) API Frontend: Designed in Streamlit
            
 4. Step in Implementation
            1) Create nodes using python file Blockchain node 5015,5016,5017
            2) connect the nodes using postman
            3) open the file FrontEnd.py through stremlit and choose appropriate stakeholder like Farmer, Processor, Distributor, Retailer
            4) enter the details being asked like Batch ID, Shipped Date, Shipped To etc
            5) Click Add Details to add transaction to the blockchain network and mine the block to store information in nodes.
            6) replace the chain through postman to have infomation stored in all the nodes of the blockchain.
